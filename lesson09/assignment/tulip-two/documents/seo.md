What I learned about SEO
Lesson 10 taught me that SEO is essentially leveraging search engines to get your website or app more and better views. Following SEO guidelines means structuring and building your website in such a way that search engines like Google and Bing will put it at the top of search results pages. This involves putting the most important information and keywords higher up on the page and/or in h1 tags. Other things that contribute to good SEO are quality links into and out of the site, and a strong domain name.

I realized that I'm very trusting of the results that Google gives me when I search for something, so why wouldn't that be true for the users of my site? I want to make it as easy to understand and friendly as possible, not only so that it performs well in SEO, but also to provide an optimal user experience that makes people want to revisit.

SEO implementation on Tulip Moment
Ideally, I would implement SEO with social media share buttons, particularly Facebook. I would also like to ensure the right keywords are implemented after researching peers and competitors. Lastly, I would continually use Google Analytics to monitor how my pages and site are performing.
